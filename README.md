# Sujeet Sanjay Amberkar

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech at Manipal Institute of Technology and I'm deeply fascinated with the complexities and challenges in the fields of cryptography and quantum computing.

## Repositories

### Cryptography & Quantum Computing
I've dedicated a significant amount of time to studying and documenting my journey in cryptography and quantum computing. You'll find comprehensive notes and innovative projects that reflect my understanding and contributions to these domains.

#### Post Quantum Banking Prototype
One of my notable projects is a prototype for Post-Quantum Banking, envisioning the future of secure financial transactions in the quantum era. It's a testament to my commitment to practical and future-ready solutions.

### Data Structures & Algorithms
I'm an avid problem-solver and have practiced numerous questions on LeetCode to sharpen my Data Structures and Algorithms skills. My repository is a treasure trove of solved problems, each reflecting the application of theoretical concepts to practical scenarios.

### Web Scraper for Flipkart
E-commerce is another area of interest, and I've developed a web scraper specifically for Flipkart to analyze product trends and pricing strategies. It's a handy tool for anyone interested in the intersection of web technology and commerce.

## Education
I'm currently honing my skills in technology and engineering at the Manipal Institute of Technology, a place that fosters innovation and expertise.
